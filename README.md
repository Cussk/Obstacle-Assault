 Platformer learning intro C++ for Unreal.
 
 Used C++ to create custom class for moving and rotating platforms.  Created blueprints from this class to have different obstacles that move horizontally, vertically and rotate.  Repurposed assets from Epics Learn to Code project and Stylized Character Kit from the Marketplace to create a fun colourful obstacle course.
